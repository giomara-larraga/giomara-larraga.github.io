  Interactive methods support decision-makers in finding the most preferred solution for multiobjective optimization problems, where multiple conflicting objective functions must be optimized simultaneously. These methods let a decision-maker provide preference information iteratively during the solution process to find solutions of interest, allowing them to learn about the trade-offs in the problem and the feasibility of the preferences. Several interactive evolutionary multiobjective optimization methods have been proposed in the literature. In the evolutionary computation community, the so-called decomposition-basedmethods have been increasingly popular because of their good performance in problems with many objective functions. They decompose the multiobjective optimization problem into multiple sub-problems to be solved collaboratively. Various interactive versions of decomposition-based methods have been proposed. However, most of them do not consider the desirable properties of real interactive solution processes, such as avoiding imposing a high cognitive burden on the decision-maker, allowing them to decide when to interact with the method, and supporting them in selecting a final solution. This paper reviews interactive evolutionary decomposition-based multiobjective optimization methods and different methodologies utilized to incorporate interactivity in them. Additionally, desirable properties of interactive decomposition-based multiobjective evolutionary optimization methods are identified, aiming to make them easier to be applied in real-world problems.
