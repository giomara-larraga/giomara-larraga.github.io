abstract: >-
  Interactive evolutionary multiobjective methods enable a decision maker to solve optimization problems involving multiple conflicting objective functions by iteratively incorporating preference information. When applying interactive methods, two phases can often be identified: a learning phase, where a decision maker gains insights on trade-offs and identifies a region of interest based on their preferences, and a decision phase focused on fine-tuning and selecting the most preferred solution. The configuration of evolutionary operators, like selection, crossover, and mutation, heavily influences the performance of evolutionary methods. However, despite extensive research on parameter tuning, identifying optimal configurations for these operators within interactive methods while accounting for the specific goals of each phase has not been studied. This study introduces a framework for the automatic configuration of interactive methods, taking the first step toward addressing this research gap. The framework systematically identifies phase-specific optimal configurations by combining the PHI indicator with the irace automatic configuration tool. Experiments with interactive RVEA and interactive RNSGA-II on problems involving three, five, and seven objective functions reveal notable differences in optimal configurations between the learning and decision phases. These findings lay a foundation for enhancing the performance of interactive evolutionary multiobjective methods and highlight the importance of phase-specific configurations.
