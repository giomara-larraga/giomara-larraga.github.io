  <p>
    My research focuses on supporting decision-making under conflicting objectives through interactive multiobjective evolutionary algorithms. I develop methods and user interfaces that guide decision makers toward preferred compromises efficiently, without increasing cognitive load. My work combines optimization, visualization, and human-centered design.
